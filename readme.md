# Imagine3D

Imagine3D is an innovative approach that uses Machine Learning concepts and AR to give students and professionals better understanding of their subject/field. Budding professionals and students pursuing science face a large number of problems in understanding their subjects. This can be attributed to factors like:

* Lack of proper visual representation of important components
* Lack of interactive physical diagrams that help in better understanding of the subject/concept through real time interactions
* No proper mechanism of quick notes/quizzes provided alongside such visual representations that help in improvement of subject knowledge.

_This has resulted in an unnecessary struggle for students to go on a resource hunting spree....which is not always available tbh_
 

## Our Solution

Imagine3D - An ML based AR visualisation software that helps students to understand difficult concepts on spot. 

* Scan images and get 3D Models for the desired object
* Allows users to interact with 3D Models using various finger gestures
* Has a facility to create and store notes 
* Take short quizzes to improve understanding 

To use the application: 
```bash
git clone -b frontend https://github.com/Riddhiman018/MLH_HACKODISHA.git
```
After installing yarn, navigate to project directory, run:
```bash
yarn install
